## Introduction
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It was first introduced in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications Corporation, and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. In this article, we will explore the basics of JavaScript and why it has become such a popular language.
<br>

- **What is JavaScript?** <br>
JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is often referred to as the “language of the web” because it is the primary language used to create web applications. Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript does not need to be compiled before it can be executed. Instead, it is interpreted by the web browser.

- **Why is JavaScript so popular?** <br>
JavaScript has become so popular because of its versatility and ease of use. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, from creating simple web applications to building complex enterprise-level systems. It is also supported by all major web browsers, making it accessible to a vast audience. <br> <br>
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means that it runs on the user’s computer rather than the web server. This makes it ideal for creating dynamic and interactive web pages because it allows developers to create real-time updates and user interactions without having to refresh the page. <br> <br>
JavaScript is also an object-oriented language, which means that it uses objects to represent data and functionality. This makes it easy to create reusable code and to organize code into manageable components.

- **What can you do with JavaScript?** <br>
JavaScript can be used to create a wide range of applications, from simple web pages to complex web applications. Here are some of the things you can do with JavaScript: <br> <br>
    1. Create dynamic web pages JavaScript can be used to create dynamic web pages that respond to user input and update in real-time. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including event listeners, animations, and AJAX requests. <br> <br>
    2. Build web applications JavaScript can be used to create complex web applications that offer a rich user experience. This can be done using popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. <br> <br>
    3. Create games JavaScript can be used to create simple games that can be played in the browser. This can be done using popular game engines like Phaser and PixiJS. <br> <br>
    4. Build server-side applications JavaScript can also be used to build server-side applications using popular frameworks like Node.js. This allows developers to create full-stack web applications using a single programming language. <br>

**Conclusion** <br> 
JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language that is used to create a wide range of web applications. It is easy to learn, widely supported, and offers a rich set of features that make it ideal for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. If you are interested in learning JavaScript, there are many online resources available that can help you get started. <br> <br>

Here's a simple JavaScript code snippet that calculates the sum of two numbers and displays the result on the webpage: <br>

```
JavaScript

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>

	<h1>JavaScript Example</h1>

	<p>Enter two numbers to calculate their sum:</p>

	<input type="number" id="num1">
	<input type="number" id="num2">

	<button onclick="calculateSum()">Calculate Sum</button>

	<p id="result"></p>

	<script>
		function calculateSum() {
			let num1 = parseInt(document.getElementById("num1").value);
			let num2 = parseInt(document.getElementById("num2").value);
			let sum = num1 + num2;
			document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + sum;
		}
	</script>

</body>
</html>

```

1. We start by creating an HTML document with a header, a title, and a body.

2. Inside the body, we create a heading and a paragraph explaining what the code does.

3. We create two input fields for the user to enter two numbers.

4. We create a button with an onclick event that calls a JavaScript function when clicked.

5. We create an empty paragraph where we will display the result of the calculation.

6. We define the JavaScript function calculateSum() which does the following:
    - Gets the values of the two input fields and converts them from strings to integers using the parseInt() function.
    - Calculates the sum of the two numbers.
    - Displays the result in the empty paragraph by setting its innerHTML property.
7. We close the script tag and the body and HTML tags.

When the user enters two numbers and clicks the "Calculate Sum" button, the calculateSum() function is called, and the sum of the two numbers is displayed on the webpage.

This is a simple example of how JavaScript can be used to add interactivity to a webpage by allowing users to input data and displaying the results of calculations.
